// Node.js and client-side JavaScript are both based on the JavaScript programming language,
// but they have some fundamental differences:

// 1 - Environment: Node.js is designed to run JavaScript code on the server-side,
//     while client-side JavaScript runs in the user's web browser.

// 2 - Capabilities: Client-side JavaScript is limited to what is available in the web browser's JavaScript engine,
//     while Node.js can access system resources like files and network sockets,
//     making it suitable for building server-side applications.

// 3 - Modules: Node.js has a built-in module system that allows developers to easily import and export code,
//     while client-side JavaScript relies on external libraries or frameworks to provide similar functionality.

// 4 - Event-driven programming: Both Node.js and client-side JavaScript use an event-driven programming model,
//     but the events in client-side JavaScript are typically user-driven (like button clicks or form submissions),
//     while Node.js events are often related to I/O operations (like reading from a file or making a network request).

// 5 - DOM manipulation: Client-side JavaScript has access to the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page,
//     allowing developers to manipulate the content and structure of the page dynamically.
//     Node.js does not have access to the DOM,
//     since it runs on the server-side and is not tied to a specific web page.

// Overall, Node.js and client-side JavaScript have different use cases and capabilities,
// but they both rely on the same fundamental language and programming concepts.
